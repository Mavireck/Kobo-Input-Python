# Kobo-Input-Python
Basic Python library for handling touch input on Kobo


This is a port of a Go librairy from shermp : 
https://github.com/shermp/go-kobo-input

I personally know Python better, so I ported it for easier use within my Python apps.
To use it, just import this script in your app. There is some help at the beginning of the script if needed.

You may find an example about how to use it here :

It has only been tested on a Kobo H20 first edition. It will probably not work well without further modifications on other Kobos
