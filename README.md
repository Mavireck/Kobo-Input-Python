# Kobo-Input-Python
Basic Python library for handling touch input on Kobo


This is a port of a Go librairy from shermp : 
https://github.com/shermp/go-kobo-input

I personally know Python better, so I ported it for easier use within my Python scripts.
To use it, just import this script in your app.

You may find an example about how to use it here :

It has only been tested on a Kobo H20 first edition. It will probably not work well without further modifications on other Kobos
